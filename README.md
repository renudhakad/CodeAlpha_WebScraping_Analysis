# CodeAlpha_WebScraping_Analysis
📌 Project Title:
Web Scraping and Analysis of Online Bookstore Data

📝 Project Summary:

In this project, I used web scraping techniques to collect data from an online bookstore. The dataset includes information about book titles, prices, availability status,
and customer ratings.

After extracting the data using Python and BeautifulSoup, I cleaned and structured the dataset into a usable format. 
I then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights such as:

1)Average and range of book prices
2)Frequency of different ratings
2)Availability trends and so on....

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to gather real-world data from websites, preprocess it, and derive business-relevant insights. 
This workflow reflects practical skills in data scraping, data wrangling, and analysis — all crucial for data-driven decision-making in e-commerce and retail sectors.
